series -n 100 -f "[%s] %s %s" \
-- time today -p 300 \
-- linear 0 1 \
-- fib abc

series [OPTIONS] SERIES
  -o offset (0)
  -n num
  -l list
  -t throttle
  -f format
  -i print index
  -x x series (default index)

Then each series has it's own options/args.  Hence the splitting by --.  Degrades to:

  series -n 100 time today tomorrow
  series -n 10 line 0 1

When calculating the value for each row, call with value of x series.  The
x series can be a separate enum that gets called with the x index.
